> Want = Git + Compute

Git models filesystem data as immutable Trees and Blobs.
Directories are Trees, and files are Blobs.

In Want, all Values are Trees or Blobs.

As you will learn in the later sections: you can specify them literally, you can select them from the project source, you can get them from the network, and you can compute them.

It doesn't matter where they come from, all data turns into Trees and Blobs in the end.
