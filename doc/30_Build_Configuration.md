# Build Configuration

Want configuration is mostly done using 2 types of files: *Expression* files, which end in `.want` and *Statement* files, which end in `.wants`.

The 3rd configuration file is the `WANT` file at the root of every module.

All Want configuration is done using [Jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/).  Want provides a small standard library of functions, which you can read about [here](./34_Standard_Library.md).
